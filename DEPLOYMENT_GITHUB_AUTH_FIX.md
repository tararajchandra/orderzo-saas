# GitHub Authentication Fix for Coolify Deployment

## 🚨 Error You're Seeing

```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
```

**Cause:** Coolify cannot authenticate to your private GitHub repository.

---

## ✅ Solution: Add GitHub Authentication to Coolify

### Method 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Configure the token:
   - **Note:** `Coolify Deployment - OrderZoV2`
   - **Expiration:** 90 days (or No expiration for convenience)
   - **Select scopes:**
     - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ `read:org` (if using organization repos)

4. Click **"Generate token"**
5. **⚠️ COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** - You won't see it again!
   - Example: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### Step 2: Add Token to Coolify

**Option A: Via Coolify UI (Recommended)**

1. Open Coolify dashboard: `http://your-vps-ip:8000`
2. Go to **"Sources"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"+ Add Source"**
4. Select **"GitHub"**
5. Choose **"Personal Access Token"** as authentication method
6. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `GitHub - chandratararaj-ctrl`
   - **Token:** Paste your token from Step 1
   - **API URL:** `https://api.github.com` (default)
7. Click **"Save"**
8. Coolify will verify the connection

**Option B: Update Existing Application**

1. Go to your application in Coolify
2. Click **"Configuration"** → **"Source"**
3. Under **"Git Repository"**, click **"Edit"**
4. Select the GitHub source you just created
5. Repository URL: `https://github.com/chandratararaj-ctrl/OrderZoV2`
6. Branch: `main`
7. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 3: Redeploy

1. In your application, click **"Deploy"**
2. Watch the build logs
3. The deployment should now succeed!

### Method 2: SSH Authentication (Alternative)

#### Step 1: Generate SSH Key in Coolify

1. In Coolify, go to **"Sources"** → **"+ Add Source"**
2. Select **"GitHub"** → **"SSH Key"**
3. Coolify will generate an SSH key pair
4. **Copy the public key** shown on screen

#### Step 2: Add SSH Key to GitHub

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click **"New SSH key"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Title:** `Coolify VPS - OrderZoV2`
   - **Key:** Paste the public key from Coolify
4. Click **"Add SSH key"**

#### Step 3: Update Repository URL

1. In Coolify, go to your application
2. Edit the repository URL from:
   ```
   https://github.com/chandratararaj-ctrl/OrderZoV2
   ```
   To:
   ```
   git@github.com:chandratararaj-ctrl/OrderZoV2.git
   ```
3. Save and redeploy

---

### Method 3: Make Repository Public (Quick Fix)

⚠️ **Only if your repository doesn't contain sensitive data!**

1. Go to: https://github.com/chandratararaj-ctrl/OrderZoV2/settings
2. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click **"Change visibility"** → **"Make public"**
4. Confirm the action
5. Redeploy in Coolify (no other changes needed)

**Note:** Your `.env` files should already be in `.gitignore`, so secrets won't be exposed.

---

## 🔍 Verify the Fix

After applying one of the methods above:

1. **Trigger a new deployment** in Coolify
2. **Watch the build logs** - you should see:
   ```
   Cloning repository...
   ✓ Successfully cloned repository
   ```
3. **Check for errors** - the `git ls-remote` command should succeed

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

**For Production:** Use **Method 1 (Personal Access Token)** because:
- ✅ Easy to set up
- ✅ Easy to revoke if compromised
- ✅ Works with both public and private repos
- ✅ Can be scoped to specific permissions

**For Development:** Use **Method 3 (Public Repo)** if:
- ✅ No sensitive data in repository
- ✅ Open source project
- ✅ Quick testing needed

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Personal Access Tokens:
1. ✅ Set expiration dates (90 days recommended)
2. ✅ Use minimal required scopes
3. ✅ Store token securely (password manager)
4. ✅ Rotate tokens regularly
5. ✅ Revoke unused tokens

### For SSH Keys:
1. ✅ Use separate keys for different services
2. ✅ Add descriptive titles
3. ✅ Remove unused keys
4. ✅ Monitor key usage in GitHub settings

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid credentials" after adding token

**Solution:**
1. Verify token has `repo` scope
2. Check token hasn't expired
3. Regenerate token if needed
4. Make sure you copied the entire token

### Issue: "Repository not found"

**Solution:**
1. Verify repository URL is correct
2. Check token has access to the repository
3. If using organization repo, ensure token has `read:org` scope

### Issue: SSH key not working

**Solution:**
1. Verify public key was copied completely
2. Check SSH key is added to correct GitHub account
3. Test SSH connection from VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

## 📝 Quick Reference

### GitHub Token Scopes Needed:
```
✅ repo (required)
✅ read:org (if using organization repos)
```

### Repository URL Formats:
```bash
# HTTPS (with token)
https://github.com/chandratararaj-ctrl/OrderZoV2

# SSH
git@github.com:chandratararaj-ctrl/OrderZoV2.git
```

### Coolify Source Types:
- **GitHub App** - Best for organizations
- **Personal Access Token** - Best for personal repos ⭐
- **SSH Key** - Alternative to PAT
- **Public Repository** - No auth needed

---

## ✅ Next Steps After Fix

Once authentication is working:

1. ✅ Verify deployment succeeds
2. ✅ Set up auto-deploy on push (optional)
3. ✅ Configure webhooks for automatic deployments
4. ✅ Test the deployed application
5. ✅ Set up environment variables
6. ✅ Run database migrations
